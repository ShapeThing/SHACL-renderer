# <img src="/logo.svg" style={{marginBottom: '-6px', height: '30px'}} /> SHACL-renderer

A React Component which renders a SHACL shape as:

- a form
- a view
- an inline edit form
- facets
- a JavaScript object
- a TypeScript type

This is a work in progress...

- Supports a subset of SHACL
- Also works without a SHACL shape
- You can add your own widgets
